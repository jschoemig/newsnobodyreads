                    This webpage is the product of a personal learning expierence. 
                    After having gained interest in full stack development I learnt the foundations from the Udemy Web Developer Course. 
                    So, what you see here is the outcome of early stage knowledge in HTML, CSS, JS, React and AWS. 
                    I am sure this site can be significantly enhanced from a technical point of view and I am sure that I will do so with every new piece I learn.
                    Please find underneath an as good as I can description of the frameworks and systems deployed mentioned before.
                </p>
